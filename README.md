### Project 

 This GitHub repository houses the complete code of the 2048 game and Dockerfile for deploying the game on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. the Dockerfile, utilizing Ubuntu 22.04 as the base image , includes installations of essential utilities such as ZIP and Nginx, enhancing the overall performance of the game. I have deployed the game to AWS Elasticbeanstalk. An IAM role, 'aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role,' is created to grant necessary permissions to EC2 instances, facilitating a secure and controlled environment.

 Key Features:

    Docker Containerization: The game is containerized using a Docker file, making it portable and easy to deploy across different environments.
    AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment: Utilizing the Elastic Beanstalk service, the Docker container is seamlessly deployed on AWS, providing a scalable and managed environment.
    IAM Role Configuration: The project incorporates the creation and configuration of an IAM role, specifically 'aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role,' ensuring secure and granular permissions for the EC2 instances running the game
